My hair is grey, but not with years,
Nor grew it white
    In a single night,
As men''s have grown from sudden fears:
My limbs are bowed, though not with toil,
  But rusted with a vile repose,
For they have been a dungeon''s spoil,
  And mine has been the fate of those
To whom the goodly earth and air
Are banned, and barred--forbidden fare;
But this was for my father''s faith
I suffered chains and courted death;
That father perished at the stake
For tenets he would not forsake;
And for the same his lineal race
In darkness found a dwelling place;
We were seven--who now are one,
  Six in youth, and one in age,
Finished as they had begun,
  Proud of Persecution''s rage;
One in fire, and two in field,
Their belief with blood have sealed,
Dying as their father died,
For the God their foes denied;--
Three were in a dungeon cast,
Of whom this wreck is left the last.
